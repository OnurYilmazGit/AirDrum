# AirDrum


If you are a drummer, it is really difficult to have such a loud instrument in your home. Also, one of the disadvantages of the drum instrument is that you may not have the chance to always take it anywhere due to its physical size. Such problems create a serious obstacle to those who want to play or learn drums.
As a drummer, I decided to make a computer application based on such problems. Thanks to this application, I made it possible for the musician to play the drums wherever and whenever s(he) wants to play the drums thanks to a computer with a camera and a drumstick pair. In this way, I ensure that the musician plays as much as s(he) wishes without the need to buy a drum and without disturbing another.

At the final version of my project, any drummer can play the drum using the whole body which looking game screens are divided into 5 parts as snare, hi-hat and bass drum, left and right crash.

To play this game, you have to install libraries in main2.py file.

Enjoy the game.
